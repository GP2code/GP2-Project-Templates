# Clinical Data Templates

**LAST UPDATED:** December 2025

## Overview

Welcome to the **GP2 Project Data Submission Repository** for active projects within GP2. This repository provides standardized data entry templates for collaborators contributing study data to GP2 projects through the [QC App](https://gp2-clinical-qc-dot-gp2-data-explorer.uc.r.appspot.com/).

> **Note:** This app is currently under development and more modalities will be added soon! The app currently supports Hoehn & Yahr, CISI-PD, and MDS UPDRS Parts II and III.

Using this standardized format ensures all submitted data can be efficiently integrated and analyzed by the consortium's analysis team.

If you have any questions or need to submit data that is not currently supported by the QC app, please contact clinicaldata@gp2.org for additional support.

## FAQ

### Which IDs should I use when preparing the data?

*If you have already sent samples to GP2, use the same IDs you provided in your sample manifest(s). If you have not yet submitted samples, use the same ID you will use when you ship your samples.*
  
### I have data that does not exactly match the GP2 variables, but are related. How do I handle that data?

*You can derive certain variables. For example, you may use custom questionnaires to collect smoking data that do not match GP2 variables exactly. You can transform the variables to match the     expected values or you can contact a member of the clinical data team for support on how to best represent the data you have collected and would like to submit.*
  
### What if I have data that can be useful for a project, but there is no provided template that can be used for data entry?

*Email clinicaldata@gp2.org with your name, study/cohort information, which project you would like to contribute to, and what data you would like to share. Prepare your data similar to how the   templates are structured and save as a `.csv`. A member of the clinical data team will walk you through the alternative process of submitting your data. There are two options: email as an   attachment or deposit into the provided Drive folder.*

### My institution has strict data sharing policies and might not approve of the alternative transfer methods. What are other options for sharing data with GP2?

*Share this information with the clinical data manager who has responded to your email. They will provide other secure transfer methods with instructions. These options include file encryption   or sending encrypted emails.*
  
### My institution requires a data request form before we can share clinical data. How can GP2 accommodate these kinds of requests?

*When emailing our team, detail your institution's process for data sharing. A member of the team will be able to fill out and submit official data requests forms for specific projects.*
